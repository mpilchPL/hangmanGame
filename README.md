# hangmanGame
Simple hangman game for command line, written in c#
To start, you need to simply download & unpack files, then double click on HangmanGame.exe. 

Why do I code? Honestly because I want to be a profssional programmer. I do find it fun and enjoyable obviously, but its mostly for professional goals.
But then... when I rethink it over again - it really depends on a day though. Cheers :D
